# What it's typescript?
- Writing Typescript is the same as writing Javascript with some "extra documentation"
- Typescript has no effect on how our code gets executed by the browser or Node
- It is best to think of typescript as being like a friend sitting behind you while you are coding

# For a one time setup
```
npm i -g typescript ts-node
```

## Optional
1. Add code to path
1. Install Prettier
1. Run prettier on save (change in settings, and activate Format On Save)
